# Keep the index of nodetypes in Neos CMS

A Neos CMS package that keeps the index of nodetypes the same in all dimensions.

## Installation

The NeosRulez.DimensionsIndexKeeper package is listed on packagist (https://packagist.org/packages/neosrulez/dimensionsindexkeeper) - therefore you don't have to include the package in your "repositories" entry any more.

Just run:

```
composer require neosrulez/dimensionsindexkeeper
```
